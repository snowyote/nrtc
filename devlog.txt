My current problem is that I'm worn out from a few previous positions
I've held and coding doesn't light me up like it used to.  Although,
to be fair, I've never really been good about coding on my own time,
for my own projects - I may write small scripts now and then to
scratch particular itches (usually solvers for super annoying
minigames), but never polished projects, which means my skill
development only happens for 'work stuff'.  And, since I'm a fairly
reliable and noncomplaining guy, I end being saddled with legacy stuff
(although I've been lucky enough to have a few green-field projects
here and there).  So if I want to learn things, especially new tech, I
have to do it myself.

I'd like to learn Node.js and socket.io, because those let you do cool
things with webpages that were previously kind of cumbersome.  I am a
pretty much total stranger to web development, though I've done
backend web service development in Rails.  I understand Javascript and
have worked with CoffeeScript and jQuery, though the vast majority of
my professional background is in C/C++ game development.  So, this
would be new and fun for me!

I recently saw a video of "Kung Fu Chess", which is a variant of chess
in which there aren't turns.  You can move any piece at any time
(modulo a cooldown).  It looked fascinating and fun and it seemed like
a straightforward thing to up-and-clone (maybe I'll modify the rules
later, but it seems like a good basic starting point for a game).

So, what do I start with?

First things first, I'm going to need a 'playable' single-player local
javascript version of chess.  Once that's done, I can worry about
hooking up the moves to socket.io events, and once that's done I can
worry about allocating games / keeping track of persistent scores /
all that metagamey crap.  But first I need a board, and I need to be
able to move pieces around on it.

well, first I need a git repo.  So, here we go!

bash-3.2$ pwd
/Users/ben
bash-3.2$ git init nrtc
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/ben/nrtc/.git/
bash-3.2$ cd nrtc
bash-3.2$ git add -A devlog.txt 
bash-3.2$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
[master (root-commit) REDACTED] initial commit
 1 file changed, 44 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 devlog.txt
bash-3.2$ 

Yeah, I guess I don't need to be that verbose.  Step one!  Complete!

So to prototype the game board and pieces, I'm going to make a little
skeletal html page that contains nothing but the board, sets up the
initial piece layout, and lets me move them around.  I'm going to use
CoffeeScript for this, because I like the language and I want to gain
more fluency with it.  I know that in the node project, there is some
kinda thing you can do so that .coffee will be automatically compiled
to .js and cached and cool things like that, but that's yak-shaving at
this point.  I don't need performance right now, and I certainly don't
need to set up a node project, so let's just make a little HTML file
that pulls CoffeeScript from a CDN (gotta be out there somewhere,
right?) so that I can use script type text/coffee directly in html.

Ooh, thanks CDNJS!
